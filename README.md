# Climate-Change-in-the-U.S.-Mind

## I. Purpose of the Research
:small_orange_diamond: To compare Americans' perceptions of climate change issues, across political ideology <br>
:small_orange_diamond: To identify climate change issues/policy areas that are likely to draw bipartisan support, in order to accelerate America's path towards decarbonization

## IV. Findings

<br> :notebook_with_decorative_cover::pencil2: For a detailed review, please refer to the [Summary Report](https://github.com/quinnei/Climate-Change-in-the-U.S.-Mind/blob/main/3_Summary%20Report/Summary%20Report_Climate%20Change%20in%20the%20American%20Mind.pdf)

<br> :small_orange_diamond: In general, climate solutions that *offset* (rather than *reduce*) carbon emissions draw the least public resistance (i.e. Americans favor climate mitigation policies that require less sacrifice on their part) <br>
:small_orange_diamond: For Conservatives, loss of freedom is a deterrent for endorsing climate-friendly regulations <br>
:small_orange_diamond: Conservatives are also averse to the phase-out of clean vehicles, suggesting that tax incentives for electric vehicles will fail to gain traction among such groups <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: However, not all Conservatives are steadfast climate skeptics. Conservatives from underserved communities are more amenable to behavioral change <br>
:small_orange_diamond: Cutting down unnecessary energy consumption is of mutual interest, regardless of partisanship <br>
:small_orange_diamond: To elicit support all-across-the-board, climate mitigation policies should tackle concerns about rising fuel prices, costs of living, and
unemployment, all of which relate to ‘quotidian’ aspects of our lives <br>
:small_orange_diamond: Climate solutions should be communicated via domain experts/scientists, given low levels of trust in politicians and the media <br>
